# Pacman

This project includes :
1.Pacman - which moves according to the user's inputs. 
The pacman will continue to move in this direction even if the user doesn’t press any key, as long as the pacman doesn’t hit a wall and the “STAY” key was not pressed.
The pacman travels on screen and “eats the breadcrumbs”. Each eaten breadcrumb equals a point to be earned.

2.Ghosts - There are 3 possible levels:
BEST - Ghost try to chase the pacman
GOOD - Ghost try to chase the pacman, but occasionally they just change to a random direction.
NOVICE - Ghost just move on screen with a direction selected randomly.

3.A Fruit - a digit selected randomly, that appears at random points in time on screen and travels around randomly.
If the pacman eats the fruit it gets the points as the value of the digit.

4.Invisible tunnels-only for pacman !

5.Loading Screens from files - 
The game would look for files in the working directory, with the names pacman_*.screen.
You can plat with a specific screen or play with all screens that are exist.

* Pressing the ESC key during a game pauses the game.

Enjoy your game !
